Choose Exchange V1 or Exchange V2 queries
The Injective Python SDK provides two different clients for interacting with the exchange:

Example - Exchange V1 Client

from injective.async_client import AsyncClient
from injective.network import Network

async def main():
    # Initialize client with mainnet
    client = AsyncClient(network=Network.mainnet())
    # Or use testnet
    # client = AsyncClient(network=Network.testnet())
    # Use V1 exchange queries here
Exchange V1 Client (async_client module):
Use this client if you need to interact with the original Injective Exchange API
Import using: from injective.async_client import AsyncClient
Suitable for applications that need to maintain compatibility with the original exchange interface
Example - Exchange V2 Client

from injective.async_client_v2 import AsyncClient
from injective.network import Network

async def main():
    # Initialize client with mainnet
    client = AsyncClient(network=Network.mainnet())
    # Or use testnet
    # client = AsyncClient(network=Network.testnet())
    # Use V2 exchange queries here
Exchange V2 Client (async_client_v2 module):
Use this client for the latest exchange features and improvements
Import using: from injective.async_client_v2 import AsyncClient
Recommended for new applications and when you need access to the latest exchange features
Both clients provide similar interfaces but with different underlying implementations. Choose V2 for new projects unless you have specific requirements for V1 compatibility.

Market Format Differences:

V1 AsyncClient: Markets are initialized with values in chain format (raw blockchain values)
V2 AsyncClient: Markets are initialized with values in human-readable format (converted to standard decimal numbers)
Exchange Endpoint Format Differences:

V1 Exchange endpoints: All values (amounts, prices, margins, notionals) are returned in chain format
V2 Exchange endpoints:
Human-readable format for: amounts, prices, margins, and notionals
Chain format for: deposit-related information (to maintain consistency with the Bank module)
 NOTE: The ChainClient (V1) will not receive any new endpoints added to the Exchange module. If you need access to new exchange-related endpoints or features, you should migrate to the V2 client. The V2 client ensures you have access to all the latest exchange functionality and improvements.
Golang Client
1. Create your own client repo and go.mod file

go mod init foo

2. Import SDK into go.mod

require ( github.com/InjectiveLabs/sdk-go v1.58.0 )

Consult the sdk-go repository to find the latest release and replace the version in your go.mod file. Version v1.39.4 is only an example and must be replaced with the newest release

3. Download the package

Download the package using go mod download

go mod download github.com/InjectiveLabs/sdk-go

Choose Exchange V1 or Exchange V2 queries
The SDK provides two different clients for interacting with the Injective Exchange:

Example - ChainClient

ChainClient: Use this client if you need to interact with Exchange V1. This client maintains compatibility with the original exchange implementation and is suitable for existing applications that haven't migrated to V2 yet. Note that this client will not include any new endpoints added to the Exchange module - for access to new features, you should migrate to V2.

ChainClientV2: Use this client for all new applications or when you need to interact with Exchange V2 features. This client provides access to the latest exchange functionality and improvements, including all new endpoints added to the Exchange module.

Markets Assistant

Example - Markets Assistant

The SDK provides a Markets Assistant to help you interact with markets in both V1 and V2. Here's how to create instances for each version

The Markets Assistant provides helper methods to:

Fetch market information
Get market prices
Query orderbooks
Access market statistics
Make sure to use the correct version of the Markets Assistant that matches your ChainClient version to ensure compatibility. The V1 assistant (NewMarketsAssistant) will only work with V1 markets, while the V2 assistant (NewHumanReadableMarketsAssistant) provides access to V2 markets and their features.

Format Differences

There are important format differences between V1 and V2 endpoints:

Exchange V1: All values (amounts, prices, margins, notionals) are returned in chain format (raw numbers)
Exchange V2: Most values are returned in human-readable format for better usability:
Amounts, prices, margins, and notionals are in human-readable format
Deposit-related information remains in chain format to maintain consistency with the Bank module
This format difference is one of the key improvements in V2, making it easier to work with market data without manual conversion.

Markets and Tokens information
Since version 1.49 the SDK is able also to get the markets and tokens information directly from the chain data (through the Indexer process). The benefit of this approach is that it is not necessary to update the SDK version when a new market is created in the chain or a new token is added.

Example - Get markets and tokens from Indexer (ExchangeClient)

To get the markets and tokens information directly from the chain, create an instance of MarketsAssistant using the NewMarketsAssistantUsingExchangeClient function and passing the ExchangeClient as parameter




















































Example - MarketsAssistant with all tokens

By default the MarketsAssistant will only initialize the tokens that are part of an active market. In order to let it use any of the tokens available in the chain, the user has to create the MarketsAssistant instance using the function NewMarketsAssistantWithAllTokens.

The MarketsAssistant instance can be used with the following ChainClient functions:

CreateSpotOrder
CreateDerivativeOrder

Overview
Injective is a DeFi focused layer-1 blockchain built for the next generation of decentralized derivatives exchanges. The Injective Chain is a Tendermint-based IBC-compatible blockchain which supports a decentralized orderbook-based DEX protocol and a trustless ERC-20 token bridge to the Ethereum blockchain.

It is the first decentralized exchange focused layer-1 blockchain for perpetual swaps, futures, and spot trading that unlocks the full potential of decentralized derivatives and borderless DeFi. Every component of the protocol has been built to be fully trustless, censorship-resistant, publicly verifiable, and front-running resistant.

By providing the unrestricted and unprecedented ability to express diverse views in decentralized financial markets, we strive to empower individuals with the ability to more efficiently allocate capital in our society.

Architecture Overview
Injective enables traders to create and trade on arbitrary spot and derivative markets. The entire process includes on-chain limit orderbook management, on-chain trade execution, on-chain order matching, on-chain transaction settlement, and on-chain trading incentive distribution through the logic codified by the Injective Chain's exchange module.

Architecturally there are two main services that traders should concern themselves with:

The Injective Chain node (the Chain API)
The Injective Exchange API
The trading lifecycle is as follows:

First, traders cryptographically sign a transaction containing one or more order messages (e.g. MsgBatchCreateDerivativeLimitOrders, MsgCreateSpotMarketOrder, MsgCancelDerivativeLimitOrder, etc. ).
Then the transaction is broadcasted to an Injective Chain node.
The transaction is then added to the mempool and becomes included in a block. More details on this process can be found here.
The handler for each respective message is run. During handler execution, order cancel and liquidation messages are processed immediately, whereas order creation messages are added to a queue.
At the end of the block, the batch auction process for order matching begins.
First, the queued market orders are executed against the resting orderbook (which does NOT include the new orders from the current block) and are cleared at a uniform clearing price.
Second, the queued limit orders are matched against each other and the resting orderbook to result in an uncrossed orderbook. Limit orders created in that block are cleared at a uniform clearing price while resting limit orders created in previous blocks are cleared at an equal or better price than their limit order price.
The funds are settled accordingly, with positions being created for derivative trades and assets being swapped for spot trades.
Events containing the trade and settlement information are emitted by the Chain.
The Injective Exchange API backend indexes the events and pushes updates to all subscribed traders.
Key Differences To CEX
All information is public which includes things like untriggered Stop/Take orders or pending orders in the mempool.
The data stored on-chain is minimal for performance reasons and reflects only the current state; exchange dApps provide additional historical data as well as a user interface for traders through the Injective Exchange API backend.
Usually a DEX has front-running issues, but those are mitigated at Injective through fast block times and FBA (Frequent Batch Auction).
The order of execution is different. Any new exchange action is a new transaction and is not executed immediately. Instead, it is added to a queue (mempool) and executed once the block is committed. At the time of the block commit, all included transactions happen more or less instantly. Firstly, code that is inside the handler is executed in the transaction sequence which is decided by the miner. This is not a problem since the sequence does not affect matching prices due to FBA and thus fairness is guaranteed.
To summarize the sequence of state changes on the Injective Chain:

Mempool: A queue of pending transactions.
BeginBlocker: Code that is executed at the beginning of every block. We use it for certain maintenance tasks (details can be found in the exchange module documentation).
Handler: Code that is executed when a transaction is included in a block.
EndBlocker: Code that is executed at the end of every block. We use it to match orders, calculate changes in funds, and update positions.
Comparison to CEX
Centralized Exchange (CEX)	Decentralized Exchange (DEX)
Exchange Gateway	Injective Chain Handler
Exchange Matching Engine	Injective Chain EndBlocker
Exchange Trade Report	Injective Chain EndBlocker
Co-location	Injective Node (Decentralized Validators)
Frequent Batch Auction (FBA)
The goal is to further prevent any Front-Running in a decentralized setting. Most DEX's suffer from this as all information is public and traders can collude with miners or pay high gas fees enabling them to front-run any trades. We mitigate this by combining fast block times with a Frequent Batch Auction:

In any given block:

Calculate one uniform clearing price for all market orders and execute them. For an example for the market order matching in FBA fashion, look here.
Limit orders are combined with the resting orderbook and orders are matched as long as there is still negative spread. The limit orders are all matched at one uniform clearing price. For an example for the limit order matching in FBA fashion, look here.
Trading Fees and Gas
If you are a trader on existing centralized exchanges, you will be familiar with the concept of trading fees. Traders are charged a fee for each successful trade. However, for a DEX, there are additional gas costs that must be paid to the network. And luckily, the gas fee from trading on Injective is very minimal.

If you are a trader using a DEX UI, you don't need to worry about gas costs because the exchange dApp will pay them for you. However, you will pay trading fees in full.
If you are using the API, then you will need to pay the gas costs.
The gas costs are currently minimal, 20K transactions will cost about 1 INJ.
You can set the fee_recipient to your own wallet address to save 40% of all trading fees.
 Note: trading from bank balances, which automatically uses the default subaccount 0, will cost roughly 15% more gas than trading from other subaccounts. API traders can use other subaccounts to trade to avoid the extra gas fees—read [here](https://injective.notion.site/The-new-trading-logic-to-be-introduced-in-v1-10-8b422f7bec6c4cac96459d558e917b6d) for more information.
Mark Price Margin Requirement
Quantity = 2 BTC, InitialMarginRatio = 0.05
MarkPrice = $45,000, EntryPrice = $43,000

Margin ≥ 2 * 0.05 * $45,000 = $4,500

MarginLong ≥ max(2 * (0.05 * $45,000 - ($45,000 - $43,000)), $4,500)
MarginLong ≥ max($500, $4,500) = $4,500

MarginShort ≥ max(2 * (0.05 * $45,000 - ($43,000 - $45,000)), $4,500)
MarginShort ≥ max($8,500, $4,500) = $8,500

So in this case if the trader wanted to create a short position with
an entry price which essentially starts at a loss of $2,000 as
unrealized PNL, he would need to post at a minimum $8,500 as margin,
rather than the usual required $4,500.
You might be familiar with margin requirements on Centralized Exchanges. When creating a new position, it must fulfill the following requirement:

Margin >= InitialMarginRatio * Quantity * EntryPrice
For example in a market with maximally 20x leverage, your initial margin must be at least 0.05 of the order's notional (entryPrice * quantity). On Injective additionally the margin must also fulfill the following mark price requirement:

Margin >= Quantity * (InitialMarginRatio * MarkPrice - PNL)
where PNL is the expected profit and loss of the position if it was closed at the MarkPrice.

Liquidations
Long Position:
Quantity = 1 BTC, MaintenanceMarginRatio = 0.05
EntryPrice = $50,000, Margin = $5,000

Now the MarkPrice drops down to $47,300, which is below the liquidation price of $47,368.42 (when margin = $2,368.42, maintenance ratio ≈ .04999998).

The position is auto-closed via reduce-only order:

Sell order:
Quantity = 1 BTC, Price = $0, Margin = $0

Assuming it gets matched with a clearing price of 47,100:

Liquidation Payout = Position Margin + PNL = $5,000 - $2,900 = $2,100
Liquidator Profit = $2,100 * 0.5 = $1,050
Insurance Fund Profit = $2,100 * 0.5 = $1,050
When your position falls below the maintenance margin ratio, the position can and likely will be liquidated by anyone running the liquidator bot. You will loose your entire position and all funds remaining in the position. On-chain, a reduce-only market order of the same size as the position is automatically created. The market order will have a worst price defined as Infinity or 0, implying it will be matched at whatever prices are available in the order book.

One key difference is that the payout from executing the reduce-only market order will not go towards the position owner. Instead, half of the remaining funds are transferred to the liquidator bot and the other half is transferred to the insurance fund.

If the payout in the position was negative, i.e., the position's negative PNL was greater than its margin, then the insurance fund will cover the missing funds.

Note: liquidations are executed immediately in a block before any other order matching occurs.

Fee Discounts
Fee discounts are enabled by looking at the past trailing 30 day window. As long as you meet both conditions for a tier (volume traded AND staked amount), you will receive the respective discounts.

Note that there is a caching mechanism in place which can take up to one day before being updated with a new tier.
Negative maker fee markets are not eligible for discounts.
Funding Rate
The hourly funding rate on perpetual markets determines the percentage that traders on one side have to pay to the other side each hour. If the rate is positive, longs pay shorts. If the rate is negative, shorts pay longs. The further trade prices deviate from the mark price within the hour, the higher the funding rate will be up to a maximum of 0.0625% (1.5% per day).

Closing a Position
Suppose you have an open position:

- Direction = Long
- Margin = $5,000
- EntryPrice = $50,000
- Quantity = 0.5 BTC

You create a new vanilla order for

- Direction = Sell
- Margin = $10,000
- Price = $35,000
- Quantity = 0.75 BTC

which is fully matched. First, the position is fully closed:

- OrderMarginUsedForClosing = OrderMargin * CloseQuantity / OrderQuantity
- OrderMarginUsedForClosing = $10,000 * 0.5 / 0.75 = $6,667

The proportional closing order margin is then used for the payout:

- Payout = PNL + PositionMargin + OrderMarginUsedForClosing
- Payout = ($35,000-$50,000) * 0.5 + $5,000 + $6,667 = $4,167

And a new position is opened in the opposite direction:

- Direction = Short
- Margin = $3,333
- Price = $35,000
- Quantity = 0.25 BTC
There are two ways to close a position:

Closing via Reduce-Only Order
When you close a position via a reduce-only order, no additional margin is used from the order. All reduce-only orders have a margin of zero. In addition, reduce-only orders are only used to close positions, not to open new ones.

Closing via Vanilla Order
You can also close a position via vanilla orders. When a sell vanilla order is getting matched while you have an open Long position, the position will be closed at the price of the sell order. Depending on the size of the order and position, the position may be either

partially closed
fully closed
or fully closed with subsequent opening of a new position in the opposite direction.
Note that how the margin inside the order is used depends on which of the three scenarios you are in. If you close a position via vanilla order, the margin is only used to cover PNL payouts, not to go into the position. If the order subsequently opens a new position in the opposite direction (scenario 3), the remaining proportional margin will go towards the new position.

Trading Rewards
Assume you have a trading rewards campaign with 100 INJ as rewards:

Reward Tokens: 100 INJ
Trader Reward Points = 100
Total Reward Points = 1,000

Trader Rewards = Trader Reward Points / Total Reward Points * Reward Tokens
Trader Rewards = 100 / 1,000 * 100 INJ = 10 INJ
During a given campaign, the exchange will record each trader's cumulative trading reward points obtained from trading fees (with boosts applied, if applicable) from all eligible markets. At the end of each campaign each trader will receive a pro-rata percentage of the trading rewards pool based off their trading rewards points from that campaign epoch. Those rewards will be automatically deposited into the trader's respective wallets, it's not necessary to manually withdraw them.

Reduce-Only Order Precedence
Imagine a trader has the following position:

LONG: 1 BTC with EntryPrice of $59,000
And the following SELL orders:

Buy Price	Quantity	Order Type
$66,500	0.2 BTC	Vanilla
$65,500	0.1 BTC	Reduce-only
$65,400	0.1 BTC	Vanilla
$64,500	0.3 BTC	Vanilla
$63,500	0.1 BTC	Reduce-only
This has some implications when placing new orders.

Upon placing a reduce-only order:
We check if any reduce-only orders would be invalid after executing all of the trader's other limit sell orders that have better prices in the same direction.

In our example, consider a new reduce-only order of 0.4 BTC at $64,600.

Sell Price	Quantity	Order Type
$66,500	0.2 BTC	Vanilla
$65,500	0.1 BTC	Reduce-only
$65,400	0.1 BTC	Vanilla
$64,600	0.4 BTC	Reduce-only
$64,500	0.3 BTC	Vanilla
$63,500	0.1 BTC	Reduce-only
This is perfectly valid and no further action is required. If the buy price hit $65,500 and all limit sell orders less than or equal to that price were filled, then the long position would be closed. If the price hit $66,500 and the vanilla sell order was filled, then the trader would open a 0.2 BTC short position. But what if the reduce-only order was for 0.5 BTC instead?

Sell Price	Quantity	Order Type
$66,500	0.2 BTC	Vanilla
$65,500	0.1 BTC	Reduce-only
$65,400	0.1 BTC	Vanilla
$64,600	0.5 BTC	Reduce-only
$64,500	0.3 BTC	Vanilla
$63,500	0.1 BTC	Reduce-only
If the orders are getting matched, once the last vanilla order of 0.1 BTC at $65,400 is filled, the position will have been reduced to 1 BTC - 0.1 BTC - 0.3 BTC - 0.5 BTC - 0.1 BTC = 0 BTC. The next reduce-only order of 0.1 BTC at $65,500 will thus be invalid.

To prevent that, we automatically cancel all reduce-only orders at a price where the cumulative sum of orders up to and including the reduce-only order would add up to more than the trader’s current long amount. Another way to think about it: we find the reduce-only order with the highest price such that all orders (vanilla and reduce-only) including and below that price add up in quantity to less than the long quantity. All reduce-only orders above that price will be canceled so that no reduce-only orders exist when the position is closed or short. The same concept applies to reduce-only orders on short positions, but we look for the lowest price instead of the highest on buy orders so that no reduce-only orders exist when the position is closed or long.

Upon placing a vanilla limit order:
We check if any reduce-only limit orders would be invalidated if all the orders up to and including the new vanilla limit order were filled.

In our example, consider a new vanilla order of 0.4 BTC at $64,600.

Sell Price	Quantity	Order Type
$66,500	0.2 BTC	Vanilla
$65,500	0.1 BTC	Reduce-only
$65,400	0.1 BTC	Vanilla
$64,600	0.4 BTC	Vanilla
$64,500	0.3 BTC	Vanilla
$63,500	0.1 BTC	Reduce-only
Again this perfectly valid and no further action is required because all order quantities up to the highest priced reduce-only order add up to ≤ the long position quantity. But what if the order was for 0.5 BTC instead?

Sell Price	Quantity	Order Type
$66,500	0.2 BTC	Vanilla
$65,500	0.1 BTC	Reduce-only
$65,400	0.1 BTC	Vanilla
$64,600	0.5 BTC	Vanilla
$64,500	0.3 BTC	Vanilla
$63,500	0.1 BTC	Reduce-only
If the orders are getting matched, once the last reduce-only order of $65,500 is reached, the position will have been reduced to 1 BTC - 0.1 BTC - 0.3 BTC - 0.5 BTC - 0.1 BTC = 0 BTC. A reduce-only order of 0.1 BTC after that will thus be invalid.

To prevent this, we automatically cancel the existing 0.1 BTC reduce-only order. In other words, new vanilla limit orders can invalidate and auto-cancel existing reduce-only limit orders if the reduce-only order becomes invalid at its price.

Rate Limits
The public mainnet and testnet nodes have a request rate limit associated to the requester IP address. The limits are:

20 requests/second for the "chain" group
50 requests/second for the "indexer" group
Each endpoint's section in this document clarifies which group the endpoint belongs to. When the limit is reached the server will respond sending an error response with code 429.

Order types
BUY (1): A standard buy order to purchase an asset at either the current market price or a set limit price. Market orders in Injective also have a price to stablish a limit to the market price the order will be executed with.
SELL (2): A standard sell order to sell an asset at either the current market price or a set limit price. Market orders in Injective also have a price to stablish a limit to the market price the order will be executed with.
STOP_BUY (3): A stop-loss buy order converts into a regular buy order once the oracle price reaches or surpasses a specified trigger price.
STOP_SELL (4): A stop-loss sell order becomes a regular sell order once the oracle price drops to or below a specified trigger price.
TAKE_BUY (5): A take-profit buy order converts into a regular buy order once the oracle price reaches or surpasses a specified trigger price.
TAKE_SELL (6): A take-profit sell order becomes a regular sell order once the oracle price drops to or below a specified trigger price.
BUY_PO (7): Post-Only Buy. This order type ensures that the order will only be added to the order book and not match with a pre-existing order. It guarantees that you will be the market "maker" and not the "taker".
SELL_PO (8): Post-Only Sell. Similar to BUY_PO, this ensures that your sell order will only add liquidity to the order book and not match with a pre-existing order.
BUY_ATOMIC (9): An atomic buy order is a market order that gets executed instantly, bypassing the Frequent Batch Auctions (FBA). It's intended for smart contracts that need to execute a trade instantly. A higher fee is paid defined in the global exchange parameters (currently it is two times the normal trading fee).
SELL_ATOMIC (10): An atomic sell order is similar to a BUY_ATOMIC, and it gets executed instantly at the current market price, bypassing the FBA.
Gas estimation
Interactions with the Injective Chain that involve processing will incur gas consumption. The gas required for any action is related to the interactions with the chain store, and thus, the amount of gas is not deterministic. Users sending messages to the chain in transactions must estimate the gas required. There are two primary methods for determining the gas required for a transaction:

Transaction simulation: The chain allows users to submit transactions in simulation mode. In this mode, the transaction is executed as if it were part of the next chain block, and a response is returned to the user. This response includes the gas required for the simulation. It is advisable to slightly increase the simulated gas when broadcasting the actual transaction to minimize the risk of encountering an out-of-gas error.
Gas estimation: Users can estimate the gas required for a transaction based on the messages included and the historical gas consumption of similar messages processed on-chain. For users utilizing the Injective Python SDK, the message broadcaster can assist in this estimation.
The InjectiveLabs team is developing a new functionality to make the gas requirement for certain Exchange module messages fixed, thereby making gas calculation deterministic. The fixed gas values, which will be implemented, can already serve as a reliable approximation for manually calculating the gas requirement for a transaction.

Fixed gas requirement
The following table lists message types with a fixed gas requirement. Any message not mentioned will continue to have a non-deterministic gas requirement based on chain store interactions.

Message type	Gas units
MsgCreateDerivativeLimitOrderGas	120000
MsgCreateDerivativeLimitPostOnlyOrderGas	140000
MsgCreateDerivativeMarketOrderGas	105000
MsgCancelDerivativeOrderGas	70000
MsgCreateSpotLimitOrderGas	100000
MsgCreateSpotLimitPostOnlyOrderGas	120000

Market and Limit Order Examples
Adding a Spot Market Buy Order
Maker Fee = -0.01%
Taker Fee = 0.1%

Market Buy Order:

Quantity = 1,000 INJ
Worst Price = 5 USDT
→ The account's available balance is decremented by 5,000 USDT + Taker Fee = 5,005 USDT.

Upon matching with a resting sell order with price of 4 USDT the new account balances are calculated as:

Trading Fee = 1,000 * 4 * 0.001 = 4 USDT
Credit Amount = 1,000 INJ
Debit Amount = 1,000 * 4 + 4 = 4,004 USDT
Clearing Refund = 5,005 - 4,004 = 1,001 USDT
Adding a Spot Market Sell Order
Maker Fee = -0.01%
Taker Fee = 0.1%

Market Sell Order:

Quantity = 1,000 INJ
Worst Price = 3 USDT
→ The account's available balance is decremented by 1,000 INJ.

Upon matching with a resting sell order with price of 4 USDT the new account balances are calculated as:

Trading Fee = 1,000 * 4 * 0.001 = 4 USDT
Debit Amount = 1,000 INJ
Credit Amount = 1,000 * 4 - 4 = 3,996 USDT
Clearing Refund = 0
Adding a Spot Limit Buy Order
Maker Fee = -0.01%
Taker Fee = 0.1%

We initially assume taker fees for the limit order in case the limit order is matched immediately. With price and quantity of:

Quantity = 1,000 INJ
Price = 5 USDT
→ The account's available balance is decremented by 5,000 USDT + Taker Fee = 5,005 USDT.

After the order is submitted:

If Matched Immediately: the limit order is filled and no fees are refunded since taker fees were previously deducted from the account's available balance. However, if Post-Only was selected, then the order will not be matched and will be rejected, with the trading fees being refunded. Assuming a clearing price of 4 USDT and a non Post-Only order:
Trading Fee = 1,000 * 4 * 0.001 = 4 USDT
Credit Amount = 5,000 - 4,000 = 1,000 INJ
Debit Amount = 1,000 * 4 + 4 = 4,004 USDT
Clearing Refund = 5,005 - 4,004 = 1,001 USDT
Unmatched Fee Refund = 0 USDT

If Entirely Unmatched, the order becomes a resting limit order and we refund the taker fee:
Fee Refund = 1,000 * 5 * (0.001) = 5 USDT

If Filled Later by Market Order, a maker fee will be charged, or a rebate will be credited. Since the order is filled by Market Order, the clearing price will be the price set in the limit order:
Trading Fee Rebate = 1,000 * 5 * -0.0001 = 0.5 USDT
Credit Amount = 1,000 INJ + 0.5 USDT
Debit Amount (in quote asset) = 1,000 * 5 = 5,000 USDT

If Partially Matched Immediately: the portion of the limit order that is filled immediately is charged taker fees with the rest being charged/credited maker fees/rebates. Assuming half the order is matched at a clearing price of 4 USDT and half the order is filled by Market Order at 5 USDT:

Portion Immediately Filled:
Taker Trading Fee = 500 * 4 * 0.001 = 2 USDT
Credit Amount = 500 INJ
Debit Amount (Including Fees) = 500 * 4 + 2 = 2,002 USDT
Clearing Refund = (quantity of order filled * limit price) - (quantity of order filled * clearing price) + (proportional difference between limit fees and clearing fees)= (500 * 5) - (500 * 4) + ((500 * 5) * 0.001 - (500 * 4) * 0.001) = 500.5 USDT
Unmatched Fee Refund = quantity of order unfilled * limit price * taker fee rate = 500 * 5 * 0.001 = 2.5 USDT

Rest of Order Filled Later by Market Order:
Maker Trading Fee Rebate = 500 * 5 * -0.0001 = 0.25 USDT
Credit Amount = 500 INJ
Debit Amount = 500 * 5 = 2,500 USDT
Clearing Refund = 0 USDT

In Total:
Net Trading Fee = 2 - 0.25 = 1.75 USDT
Credit Amount (Including Maker Fee Rebates) = 1000 INJ + 0.25 USDT
Debit Amount (Including Taker Fees) = 4,502 USDT
Adding a Spot Limit Sell Order
Maker Fee = -0.01%
Taker Fee = 0.1%

We initially assume taker fees for the limit order in case the limit order is matched immediately. With price and quantity of:

Quantity = 1,000 INJ
Price = 3 USDT
→ The account's available balance is decremented by 1,000 INJ.

After the order is submitted:

If Matched Immediately: the limit order is filled and taker fees are deducted, unless Post-Only is selected, in which case the order will not be matched and will be rejected with no trading fees being charged. Assuming a clearing price of 4 USDT:
Trading Fee = 1,000 * 4 * 0.001 = 4 USDT
Credit Amount = 1,000 * 4 - 4 = 3,996 USDT
Debit Amount = 1,000 INJ
Clearing Refund = 0 ETH
Fee Refund/Rebate = 0 USDT

If Filled Later by Market Order, a maker fee rebate will be credited. Since the order is filled by Market Order, the clearing price will be the price set in the limit order:
Maker Trading Rebate = 1,000 * 3 * 0.0001 = 0.3 USDT
Credit Amount (in quote asset) = 1,000 * 3 + 0.3 = 3,000.3 USDT
Debit Amount (in base asset) = 1,000 INJ

If Partially Matched Immediately: the portion of the limit order that is filled immediately is charged taker fees with the rest being charged maker fees. Similar logic to a spot limit buy order applies.
Derivative Market Order Payouts
The payouts for derivative market orders work the same way as for derivative limit orders, with the one difference being they are cancelled if not immediately matched. See spot market and derivative limit orders as reference.

Adding a Derivative Limit Buy Order
Quantity = 1,000 INJ, Price = 5 USDT, Margin = 1,000 USDT
TakerFeeRate = 0.001
MakerFeeRate = -0.0001
→ The account's available balance is decremented by Margin + Taker Fee = 1000 + 5000 * 0.001 = 1005 USDT.

After creation:

If Unmatched, the order becomes a resting limit order (maker) and we refund the taker fee on vanilla orders (reduce-only orders don't pay upfront fees):

Fee Refund = 5 USDT
If Matched:

Assuming:

a clearing price of 4 USDT
an existing SHORT position:

Position Quantity = 600 INJ
Position Entry Price = 4.5 USDT
Position Margin = 400 USDT
Would result in:

1. Closing existing position with proportional order margin for closing:

CloseExecutionMargin = ExecutionMargin * CloseQuantity / OrderQuantity = 1000 * 600 / 1000 = 600 USDT

Where CloseExecutionMargin = Portion of margin used to close position
And ExecutionMargin = Margin supplied in new order
ClosingPayout = PNL + PositionMargin * CloseQuantity / PositionQuantity + CloseExecutionMargin

Short PNL = CloseQuantity * (EntryPrice - FillPrice) = 600 * (4.5 - 4) = 300 USDT
ClosingPayout = 300 + 400 * 600 / 600 + 600 = 1300 USDT
2. Opening new position in opposite direction:

a new LONG position:

Position Quantity = 400 INJ
Position Entry Price = 4 USDT
NewPositionMargin = ExecutionMargin - CloseExecutionMargin = 1000 - 600 = 400 USDT
3. Refunding margin difference from order price vs. clearing price:

Since the order was placed with 5x leverage at a price of 5 USDT, some margin is refunded with the new clearing price to maintain the 5x leverage.
Margin Refund = NewPositionMargin - NewPositionMarginRequired = 400 - 400 * 4 / 5 = 80 USDT
4. Refunding fee difference from order price vs. clearing price:

PriceDelta = Price - ClearingPrice = 5 - 4 = 1 USDT
ClearingFeeRefund = FillQuantity * PriceDelta * TakerFeeRate = 1000 * 1 * 0.001 = 1 USDT

In the case of matching a sell order, this would have been a charge, not a refund

Market Buys: Matching the highest priced market buy order first for 0.4 BTC. Now for the second market buy order only 0.1 BTC is left at matchable price, meaning the other 0.1 BTC in the order will be cancelled. Both orders will be matched with the single resting limit order at a price of 64,360 for a total quantity of 0.5 BTC.

Market Sells: Matching the first two market sell orders for at a matching price of (64,210*0.1 + 64,205*0.2) / 0.3 = 64,206.67 for a total quantity of 0.3 BTC. The resting limit orders are both matched at their specified price points of 64,210 and 64,205. Since the last market sell order of 69,000 cannot be fulfilled, it is cancelled.

Matching Orders
All new orders are incorporated into the existing orderbook. In our case this results in a negative spread:

Sells	Buys
Price	Quantity
$64,390	0.3 BTC
$64,370	0.2 BTC
$64,250	0.5 BTC
$64,220	0.4 BTC

$64,360	0.1 BTC
$64,210	0.1 BTC
$64,205	0.3 BTC
$64,200	0.2 BTC
As long as negative spread exists, orders are matched against each other. The first buy order is fully matched:

Sells	Buys
Price	Quantity
$64,390	0.3 BTC
$64,370	0.2 BTC
$64,250	0.4 BTC
$64,220	0.2 BTC
Price	Quantity
$64,360	0.1 BTC
$64,210	0.1 BTC
$64,205	0.3 BTC
$64,200	0.2 BTC
Now the second buy order can still be fully matched:

Sells	Buys
Price	Quantity
$64,390	0.3 BTC
$64,370	0.2 BTC
$64,250	0.4 BTC
$64,220	0.1 BTC
Price	Quantity
$64,210	0.1 BTC
$64,205	0.3 BTC
$64,200	0.2 BTC
This is the end of the matching, since no more negative spread exists (64,220 > 62,210).

All orders will be matched with a uniform clearing price within the range of the last sell order price and the last buy order price.

Last sell order price: 64,220
Last buy order price: 64,360
64,220 >= Clearing price >= 64,360
Step 1: Check if clearing price range is out of bounds regarding the resting orderbook mid price.

Resting orderbook mid price: (64,250+64,210)/2 = 64,230
Is within range of clearing price ✅ (if not, a clearing price of either last buy or last sell price would be used)
Step 2: Check if clearing price range is out of bounds regarding the mark price.

Let's assume mark price is 64,300
Is within range of clearing price ✅ (if not, a clearing price of either last buy or last sell price would be used)
Step 3: Set clearing price = mid price or mark price for spot or perpetual markets, respectively, or in the case where these prices are out of bounds, use last buy or last sell price.

Message Broadcaster
In the examples included in this documentation you will see all the steps required to interact with the chain, from deriving a public key from a private key, creating messages to query the chain or creating orders, to creating and broadcasting transactions to the chain. Before going to the examples of all the possible actions it is important to state that you can avoid implementing yourself all the steps to create and configure correctly a transaction. If you are not interested in defining all the low level aspects you can use the component called MsgBroadcasterWithPk. To use the broadcaster you just need to create an instance of MsgBroadcasterWithPk, and once all the messages to be included in the transaction have been created, use the broadcast method, passing the messages as a parameter. The broadcaster will take care of: - Calculate the gas fee to pay for the transaction - Create the transaction and configure it - Sign the transaction - Broadcast it to the chain

Broadcaster for grantee account
This is the required broadcaster configuration when operating with grantee accounts. The broadcaster will take care of creating the MsgExec message, so that the user keeps passing the same messages to the broadcast method that are passed when using the standard broadcaster with non-grantee accounts.

 There an important consideration when using the Transaction Broadcaster calculating the gas cost without simulation to send a _MsgBatchUpdateOrders_ message. The logic that estimates the gas cost for the _MsgBatchUpdateOrders_ correclty calculates the gas required for each order action (creation or cancelation) it includes. But there is no easy way to calculate the gas cost when canceling all orders for a market id using one of the following parameters: `spot_market_ids_to_cancel_all`, `derivative_market_ids_to_cancel_all` or `binary_options_market_ids_to_cancel_all`. The complexity is related to the fact that the gas cost depends on the number of orders to be cancelled. By default the estimation logic calculates a gas cost considering the number of orders to cancel for each market id is 20. To improve the gas cost calculation when using the _MsgBatchUpdateOrders_ message to cancel all orders for one or more markets you can change the number of estimated orders to cancel per market. Check in the fine-tunning section the proper `AVERAGE_CANCEL_ALL_AFFECTED_ORDERS` global variable to change.
Fine-tunning message based gas fee estimation
As mentioned before the gas estimation without using simulation is implemented by using fixed values as gas cost for certain messages and actions. Since the real gas cost can differ at some point from the estimator calculations, the Python SDK allows the developer to fine-tune certain gas cost values in order to improve the gas cost estimation. In the next tables you can find the global values used for gas estimation calculations, that can be modified in your application:

Indexer API
The Indexer API is read-only whereas the Chain API is write and also includes a limited set of API requests to read data. The Chain API reads query the blockchain state from the node directly as opposed to the Indexer API which reconstructs state from events emitted by chain.

On a high-level the end-user trading applications and Injective Products use the Indexer API to read data and the Chain API to write data to the blockchain. Even though it’s possible to develop trading applications using the Chain API only, the Indexer API includes more methods, streaming support, gRPC, and also allows you to fetch historical data (the Chain API queries the blockchain state which doesn’t include historical records).

- InjectiveAccountsRPC
InjectiveAccountsRPC defines the gRPC API of the Exchange Accounts provider.

Chain API
The Indexer API is read-only whereas the Chain API is write and also includes a limited set of API requests to read data. The Chain API reads query the blockchain state from the node directly as opposed to the Indexer API which reconstructs state from events emitted by chain.

On a high-level the end-user trading applications and Injective Products use the Indexer API to read data and the Chain API to write data to the blockchain. Even though it’s possible to develop trading applications using the Chain API only, the Indexer API includes more methods, streaming support, gRPC and also allows you to fetch historical data as the Chain API queries the blockchain state which doesn’t include historical records.

- Account
Includes all messages related to accounts and transfers.

Parameter	Type	Description
tx	Tx	tx is the queried transaction.
tx_response	types.TxResponse	tx_response is the queried TxResponses.


Tx

Parameter	Type	Description
body	TxBody	body is the processable content of the transaction
auth_info	AuthInfo	auth_info is the authorization related content of the transaction, specifically signers, signer modes and fee
signatures	][byte array	signatures is a list of signatures that matches the length and order of AuthInfo's signer_infos to allow connecting signature meta information like public key and signing mode by position.


TxBody

Parameter	Type	Description
messages	types.Any array	messages is a list of messages to be executed. The required signers of those messages define the number and order of elements in AuthInfo's signer_infos and Tx's signatures. Each required signer address is added to the list only the first time it occurs. By convention, the first required signer (usually from the first message) is referred to as the primary signer and pays the fee for the whole transaction.
memo	string	memo is any arbitrary note/comment to be added to the transaction. WARNING: in clients, any publicly exposed text should not be called memo, but should be called `note` instead (see https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/issues/9122).
timeout_height	uint64	timeout is the block height after which this transaction will not be processed by the chain
extension_options	types.Any array	extension_options are arbitrary options that can be added by chains when the default options are not sufficient. If any of these are present and can't be handled, the transaction will be rejected
non_critical_extension_options	types.Any array	extension_options are arbitrary options that can be added by chains when the default options are not sufficient. If any of these are present and can't be handled, they will be ignored


AuthInfo

Parameter	Type	Description
signer_infos	SignerInfo array	signer_infos defines the signing modes for the required signers. The number and order of elements must match the required signers from TxBody's messages. The first element is the primary signer and the one which pays the fee.
fee	Fee	Fee is the fee and gas limit for the transaction. The first signer is the primary signer and the one which pays the fee. The fee can be calculated based on the cost of evaluating the body and doing signature verification of the signers. This can be estimated via simulation.
tip	Tip	Tip is the optional tip used for transactions fees paid in another denom. This field is ignored if the chain didn't enable tips, i.e. didn't add the `TipDecorator` in its posthandler. Since: cosmos-sdk 0.46


SignerInfo

Parameter	Type	Description
public_key	types.Any	public_key is the public key of the signer. It is optional for accounts that already exist in state. If unset, the verifier can use the required \ signer address for this position and lookup the public key.
mode_info	ModeInfo	mode_info describes the signing mode of the signer and is a nested structure to support nested multisig pubkey's
sequence	uint64	sequence is the sequence of the account, which describes the number of committed transactions signed by a given address. It is used to prevent replay attacks.


ModeInfo

Parameter	Type	Description
single	ModeInfo_Single	
multi	ModeInfo_Multi	
mode	signing.SignMode	mode is the signing mode of the single signer
bitarray	types1.CompactBitArray	bitarray specifies which keys within the multisig are signing
mode_infos	ModeInfo array	mode_infos is the corresponding modes of the signers of the multisig which could include nested multisig public keys


Fee

Parameter	Type	Description
amount	github_com_cosmos_cosmos_sdk_types.Coins	amount is the amount of coins to be paid as a fee
gas_limit	uint64	gas_limit is the maximum gas that can be used in transaction processing before an out of gas error occurs
payer	string	if unset, the first signer is responsible for paying the fees. If set, the specified account must pay the fees. the payer must be a tx signer (and thus have signed this field in AuthInfo). setting this field does *not* change the ordering of required signers for the transaction.
granter	string	if set, the fee payer (either the first signer or the value of the payer field) requests that a fee grant be used to pay fees instead of the fee payer's own balance. If an appropriate fee grant does not exist or the chain does not support fee grants, this will fail


Coin

Parameter	Type	Description
denom	string	
amount	cosmossdk_io_math.Int	


Tip

Parameter	Type	Description
amount	github_com_cosmos_cosmos_sdk_types.Coins	amount is the amount of the tip
tipper	string	tipper is the address of the account paying for the tip


TxResponse

Parameter	Type	Description
height	int64	The block height
txhash	string	The transaction hash.
codespace	string	Namespace for the Code
code	uint32	Response code.
data	string	Result bytes, if any.
raw_log	string	The output of the application's logger (raw string). May be non-deterministic.
logs	ABCIMessageLogs	The output of the application's logger (typed). May be non-deterministic.
info	string	Additional information. May be non-deterministic.
gas_wanted	int64	Amount of gas requested for transaction.
gas_used	int64	Amount of gas consumed by transaction.
tx	types.Any	The request transaction bytes.
timestamp	string	Time of the previous block. For heights > 1, it's the weighted median of the timestamps of the valid votes in the block.LastCommit. For height == 1, it's genesis time.
events	v1.Event array	Events defines all the events emitted by processing a transaction. Note, these events include those emitted by processing all the messages and those emitted from the ante. Whereas Logs contains the events, with additional metadata, emitted only by processing the messages. Since: cosmos-sdk 0.42.11, 0.44.5, 0.45


ABCIMessageLog

Parameter	Type	Description
msg_index	uint32	
log	string	
events	StringEvents	Events contains a slice of Event objects that were emitted during some execution.

- Authz
Includes all messages and queries related to the Authz module. Authz is an implementation of the Cosmos SDK module, that allows granting arbitrary privileges from one account (the granter) to another account (the grantee). Authorizations must be granted for a particular Msg service method one by one using an implementation of the Authorization interface.

MsgGrant
There are two types of authorization, Generic and Typed. Generic authorization will grant permissions to the grantee to execute exchange-related messages in all markets, typed authorization restricts the privileges to specified markets. Typed authorization is generally more safe since even if the grantee's key is compromised the attacker will only be able to send orders in specified markets - thus prevents them from launching bogus markets on-chain and executing orders on behalf of the granter.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())
Parameter	Type	Description	Required
denoms	string array	denoms is the specific denoms you want look up. Leave empty to get all entries.	Yes
pagination	query.PageRequest	pagination defines an optional pagination for the request. This field is only read if the denoms field is empty.	No


PageRequest

Parameter	Type	Description	Required
key	byte array	key is a value returned in PageResponse.next_key to begin querying the next page most efficiently. Only one of offset or key should be set.	Yes
offset	uint64	offset is a numeric offset that can be used when key is unavailable. It is less efficient than using key. Only one of offset or key should be set.	Yes
limit	uint64	limit is the total number of results to be returned in the result page. If left empty it will default to a value to be set by each app.	Yes
count_total	bool	count_total is set to true to indicate that the result set should include a count of the total number of items available for pagination in UIs. count_total is only respected when offset is used. It is ignored when key is set.	Yes
reverse	bool	reverse is set to true if results are to be returned in the descending order. Since: cosmos-sdk 0.43	Yes

- Chain Stream
Chain Stream is a gRPC service that allows clients to receive low-latency updates from the Injective Chain. This API is exposed directly from a dedicated server running on a chain node and provides the fastest way to receive events data (like trades, orders, balances, etc.). Under the hood, a stream message is computed by the chain node immediately after the event is emitted and is sent to the client via a gRPC stream once the block is committed.

Stream Request
Its possible to specify multiple filters to customize the stream. A filter can be specified with a list of values, generally MarketIds, SubaccountIds and Accounts address. A filter can also be omitted, in this case the stream will return all the events for the specified type. In addition each filter supports a * wildcard to match all possible values.

MsgBatchUpdateOrders
MsgBatchUpdateOrders allows for the atomic cancellation and creation of spot and derivative limit orders, along with a new order cancellation mode. Upon execution, order cancellations (if any) occur first, followed by order creations (if any).

Users can cancel all limit orders in a given spot or derivative market for a given subaccountID by specifying the associated marketID in the SpotMarketIdsToCancelAll and DerivativeMarketIdsToCancelAll. Users can also cancel individual limit orders in SpotOrdersToCancel or DerivativeOrdersToCancel, but must ensure that marketIDs in these individual order cancellations are not already provided in the SpotMarketIdsToCancelAll or DerivativeMarketIdsToCancelAll.

Further note that if no marketIDs are provided in the SpotMarketIdsToCancelAll or DerivativeMarketIdsToCancelAll, then the SubaccountID in the Msg should be left empty.

Note on LocalOrderHashComputation for HFTs/API Traders
LocalOrderHashComputation returns a locally computed transaction hash for spot and derivative orders, which is useful when the user needs the transaction hash faster than orders can be streamed through StreamOrdersHistory (there is extra latency since the order must be included by a block, and the block must be indexed by the Indexer). While the hash can also be obtained through transaction simulation, the process adds a layer of latency and can only be used for one transaction per block (simulation relies on a nonce based on the state machine which does not change until the transaction is included in a block).

On Injective, subaccount nonces are used to calculate order hashes. The subaccount nonce is incremented with each order so that order hashes remain unique.

For strategies employing high frequency trading, order hashes should be calculated locally before transactions are broadcasted. This is possible as long as the subaccount nonce is cached/tracked locally instead of queried from the chain. Similarly, the account sequence (like nonce on Ethereum) should be cached if more than one transaction per block is desired. The LocalOrderHashComputation implementation can be found here. Refer to the above API example for usage.

There are two caveats to be mindful of when taking this approach:

1. Gas must be manually calculated instead of fetched from simulation

To avoid latency issues from simulation, it's best to completely omit simulation for fetching gas and order hash.
To calculate gas, a constant value should be set for the base transaction object. The tx object consists of a constant set of attributes such as memo, sequence, etc., so gas should be the same as long as the amount of data being transmitted remains constant (i.e. gas may change if the memo size is very large). The gas can then be increased per order creation/cancellation.
These constants can be found through simulating a transaction with a single order and a separate transaction with two orders, then solving the linear equations to obtain the base gas and the per-order gas amounts.
  class GasLimitConstant:
      base = 65e3
      extra = 20e3
      derivative_order = 45e3
      derivative_cancel = 55e3
An extra 20,000 buffer can be added to the gas calculation to ensure the transaction is not rejected during execution on the validator node. Transactions often require a bit more gas depending on the operations; for example, a post-only order could cross the order book and get cancelled, which would cost a different amount of gas than if that order was posted in the book as a limit order. See example on right:
Note: In cosmos-sdk v0.46, a gas refund capability was added through the PostHandler functionality. In theory, this means that gas constants can be set much higher such that transactions never fail; however, because v0.46 was not compatible with CosmWasm during the last chain upgrade, the refund capability is not implemented on Injective. This may change in the future, but as of now, gas is paid in its entirety as set.
2. In the event a transaction fails, the account sequence and subaccount nonce must both be refreshed

If the client receives a sequence mismatch error (code 32), a refresh in sequence and subaccount nonce will likely resolve the error.
  res = await self.client.broadcast_tx_sync_mode(tx_raw_bytes)
  if res.code == 32:
      await client.fetch_account(address.to_acc_bech32())
To refresh the cached account sequence, updated account data can be fetched using the client. See example on right, using the Python client:
To refresh the cached subaccount nonce, the OrderHashManager can be reinitialized since the subaccount nonce is fetched from the chain during init.

MsgBatchUpdateOrders
MsgBatchUpdateOrders allows for the atomic cancellation and creation of spot and derivative limit orders, along with a new order cancellation mode. Upon execution, order cancellations (if any) occur first, followed by order creations (if any).

Users can cancel all limit orders in a given spot or derivative market for a given subaccountID by specifying the associated marketID in the SpotMarketIdsToCancelAll and DerivativeMarketIdsToCancelAll. Users can also cancel individual limit orders in SpotOrdersToCancel or DerivativeOrdersToCancel, but must ensure that marketIDs in these individual order cancellations are not already provided in the SpotMarketIdsToCancelAll or DerivativeMarketIdsToCancelAll.

Further note that if no marketIDs are provided in the SpotMarketIdsToCancelAll or DerivativeMarketIdsToCancelAll, then the SubaccountID in the Msg should be left empty.

Note on LocalOrderHashComputation for HFTs/API Traders
LocalOrderHashComputation returns a locally computed transaction hash for spot and derivative orders, which is useful when the user needs the transaction hash faster than orders can be streamed through StreamOrdersHistory (there is extra latency since the order must be included by a block, and the block must be indexed by the Indexer). While the hash can also be obtained through transaction simulation, the process adds a layer of latency and can only be used for one transaction per block (simulation relies on a nonce based on the state machine which does not change until the transaction is included in a block).

On Injective, subaccount nonces are used to calculate order hashes. The subaccount nonce is incremented with each order so that order hashes remain unique.

For strategies employing high frequency trading, order hashes should be calculated locally before transactions are broadcasted. This is possible as long as the subaccount nonce is cached/tracked locally instead of queried from the chain. Similarly, the account sequence (like nonce on Ethereum) should be cached if more than one transaction per block is desired. The LocalOrderHashComputation implementation can be found here. Refer to the above API example for usage.

There are two caveats to be mindful of when taking this approach:

1. Gas must be manually calculated instead of fetched from simulation

To avoid latency issues from simulation, it's best to completely omit simulation for fetching gas and order hash.
To calculate gas, a constant value should be set for the base transaction object. The tx object consists of a constant set of attributes such as memo, sequence, etc., so gas should be the same as long as the amount of data being transmitted remains constant (i.e. gas may change if the memo size is very large). The gas can then be increased per order creation/cancellation.
These constants can be found through simulating a transaction with a single order and a separate transaction with two orders, then solving the linear equations to obtain the base gas and the per-order gas amounts.
  class GasLimitConstant:
      base = 65e3
      extra = 20e3
      spot_order = 60e3
      spot_cancel = 40e3
An extra 20,000 buffer can be added to the gas calculation to ensure the transaction is not rejected during execution on the validator node. Transactions often require a bit more gas depending on the operations; for example, a post-only order could cross the order book and get cancelled, which would cost a different amount of gas than if that order was posted in the book as a limit order. See example on right:
Note: In cosmos-sdk v0.46, a gas refund capability was added through the PostHandler functionality. In theory, this means that gas constants can be set much higher such that transactions never fail; however, because v0.46 was not compatible with CosmWasm during the last chain upgrade, the refund capability is not implemented on Injective. This may change in the future, but as of now, gas is paid in its entirety as set.
2. In the event a transaction fails, the account sequence and subaccount nonce must both be refreshed

If the client receives a sequence mismatch error (code 32), a refresh in sequence and subaccount nonce will likely resolve the error.
  res = await self.client.broadcast_tx_sync_mode(tx_raw_bytes)
  if res.code == 32:
      await client.fetch_account(address.to_acc_bech32())
To refresh the cached account sequence, updated account data can be fetched using the client. See example on right, using the Python client:
To refresh the cached subaccount nonce, the OrderHashManager can be reinitialized since the subaccount nonce is fetched from the chain during init.

MsgBatchUpdateOrders
MsgBatchUpdateOrders allows for the atomic cancellation and creation of spot and derivative limit orders, along with a new order cancellation mode. Upon execution, order cancellations (if any) occur first, followed by order creations (if any).

Users can cancel all limit orders in a given spot or derivative market for a given subaccountID by specifying the associated marketID in the SpotMarketIdsToCancelAll and DerivativeMarketIdsToCancelAll. Users can also cancel individual limit orders in SpotOrdersToCancel or DerivativeOrdersToCancel, but must ensure that marketIDs in these individual order cancellations are not already provided in the SpotMarketIdsToCancelAll or DerivativeMarketIdsToCancelAll.

Further note that if no marketIDs are provided in the SpotMarketIdsToCancelAll or DerivativeMarketIdsToCancelAll, then the SubaccountID in the Msg should be left empty.

import asyncio

from pyinjective.async_client_v2 import AsyncClient
from pyinjective.client.model.pagination import PaginationOption
from pyinjective.core.network import Network


async def main() -> None:
    # select network: local, testnet, mainnet
    network = Network.testnet()
    client = AsyncClient(network)
    code_id = 3770
    limit = 2
    pagination = PaginationOption(limit=limit)
    contracts = await client.fetch_contracts_by_code(code_id=code_id, pagination=pagination)
    print(contracts)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(main())
Parameter	Type	Description	Required
code_id	uint64		Yes
pagination	query.PageRequest	pagination defines an optional pagination for the request.	No


PageRequest

Parameter	Type	Description	Required
key	byte array	key is a value returned in PageResponse.next_key to begin querying the next page most efficiently. Only one of offset or key should be set.	Yes
offset	uint64	offset is a numeric offset that can be used when key is unavailable. It is less efficient than using key. Only one of offset or key should be set.	Yes
limit	uint64	limit is the total number of results to be returned in the result page. If left empty it will default to a value to be set by each app.	Yes
count_total	bool	count_total is set to true to indicate that the result set should include a count of the total number of items available for pagination in UIs. count_total is only respected when offset is used. It is ignored when key is set.	Yes
reverse	bool	reverse is set to true if results are to be returned in the descending order. Since: cosmos-sdk 0.43	Yes

- HealthAPI
HealthAPI (HTTP) checks if backend data is up-to-date and reliable or not.

GetStatus
IP rate limit group: chain

To check the health of a node, the GetStatus API can be queried to obtain the Indexer height (localHeight) and the network height (horacleHeight). Next, the chain node height can be queried directly from the node (e.g. curl --insecure http://sentry.lcd.injective.network:26657/abci_info | grep last_block_height or in Python (await async_client.get_latest_block()).block.header.height). Comparing last_block_height with horacleHeight gives a sense of the chain node's health, with a threshold of a 20 block difference being a good starting point for detecting unhealthy nodes. localHeight and horacleHeight can also be compared to check Indexer health, though an error should already be returned from the API query if the Indexer is deemed unhealthy (more than 20 block height difference).

If LB/K8S endpoints are being used, there is no need to do these checks, as the cluster has built-in liveliness checks and excludes unhealthy nodes if any are detected.

A recommended health check frequency of once every 20-30 seconds is recommended.

Notes

horacleHeight: the network height of the chain (average returned by multiple nodes in the network)

localHeight: the latest synced block on the indexer

lastBlock: the latest synced block on the chain

Glossary
Injective Chain
The Injective Chain refers to the blockchain running the Injective Protocol. It is is the fundamental piece of infrastructure and ultimate source of truth for any trades happening on the network.

Validator / Injective Node
A validator is a node for the Injective Chain. The term node itself refers to a host computer in a network. In the context of blockchains, nodes are the computers participating in producing new blocks and validating new transactions in a peer-to-peer fashion. All on-chain code for Injective is executed on the hardware of every validator, in contrast to a CEX where code is executed on a central server.

On-chain Matching
The matching algorithm is executed as part of validating the chain. It is executed on the hardware of every validator. Therefore it must be deterministic, so every validator comes to the same matching result. For fairness reasons the matching algorithm consists of frequent batch auctions (FBA).

Frequent Batch Auction (FBA)
Frequent Batch Auctions (FBA) are ensuring fair order matching prices by calculating one uniform clearing price over all orders in the same block. Rather than calculating the clearing price for every order, the FBA algorithm calculates the clearing price for a batch of orders. For more details, here.

Relayer
The Injective Chain itself provides no historical data, no detailed statistics and no front-end. This is the role of the relayer. A relayer will index data emitted from the Injective Chain to provide an additional API and front-end.

Mempool
A mempool refers to pending transactions in a blockchain. It is the place where transactions are stored before they are included in a block.

gRPC
gRPC is a high-performance, open-source, general-purpose RPC framework that is used by the Injective Chain. It is used to communicate with the Injective Chain and the relayer.

Mark Price
Mark price refers to the oracle price for the underlying asset in a futures market. It is used to determine when a position is liquidable. Only when the mark price falls below your position's liquidation price, the position can be liquidated. The mark price is further used for market settlements, either in the case of an emergency stop due to the insurance fund draining or in the case of planned settlements for time-expiry future markets.

Perpetual Swap
A perpetual swap is a futures contract without expiry date. Since those contracts never expire with a settlement price, a new mechanism is used to align future contract prices with the mark price: the funding rate.

Funding Rate
In perpetual swaps a funding rate is used to align future contract prices with the mark price. The funding rate is calculated by keeping track of the volume weighted average of the deltas from mark price vs. trade execution price. It is applied to a position proportionally to the position's size.

FAQ
1. What are the trading fees on Injective?
Trading fees differ per market and are defined through governance for both maker and taker orders. The fees can also be reduced based on your tier which is determined based on your staked INJ and 30-day trailing fees.

Note that if you place trades through the API, you will only pay 60% of the trading fees regardless if your order is filled as a maker or taker. In every exchange-related message you can set recipient_fee to your own address in order to collect 40% of the trading fees. On the DEX UI, recipient_fee is set to the relayer's address which acts as a source of revenue but on the API you can set this field to any address of your choosing, including your own.

The DEX UI will also show you the full fees but if you have placed a trade through the API you would have paid only 60% of those fees.

2. What are the gas fees on Injective?
If you place trades through the UI on one of the available relayers you can experience gas-less trading, if you place trades from the API you will pay gas fees in INJ but they will be very low at an average of 0.00005 INJ per message. Note that the INJ to pay for gas must be in the bank balance (wallet) and not the subaccount (trading account).

3. How can I calculate the gas fees in INJ?
The minimum gas price currently accepted by nodes is 160000000. In order to find the exact INJ amount paid you multiply the gas wanted by the minimum gas price and divide by 1e18 (because INJ token has 18 decimals). For instance, if gas wanted is 104519 then you would calculate it as follows:

160000000 * 104519 / 1e18 = 0.00001672304 INJ

4. Which API nodes can I connect to?
The SDKs default to using a load balanced endpoint. It is possible also to run a local node. The guide to set up your own node can be found here.

5. Does Injective have an API support channel?
Yes, you can join the Discord and Telegram API channels to ask any questions you might have or if you need any support.

6. Can I get the order_hash (order_id) right after I send a new order?
Yes, you can actually fetch the order_hash before you even send the transaction through our simulation, you can see the Chain API examples on how to use the simulation.

A better alternative is to set a client order id (cid) to the orders. It is possible to then cancel the orders by cid instead of hash. With this it is no longer necessary to calculate the order hash in advance.

7. Are there limits in the API requests?
All public nodes have limits to the number of request they allow per IP. Please check the rate limits page.

8. What is the normal order latency I can expect?
There's no guarantee on when the chain will process your transaction. It depends on the peer to peer gossip of the network and whether your transaction reaches a given block producer to get included in a block. You can read more details about this here https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.35/assets/img/tm-transaction-flow.258ca020.png as well as the docs here https://docs.tendermint.com/v0.35/introduction/what-is-tendermint.html

We strongly recommend following the guide to setup your own infrastructure which will ultimately reduce latency to a great extent.

Following we include more details regarding transactions latency and blocks production:

- Validators might miss consensus rounds which will delay block production (instead of a 800ms block, we’ll have a 5000ms block). This happens very rarely and it’s due to issues on the validator node (they have a big chain state and they need to download a pruned snapshot, hardware resources etc.). We’re working with all validators to ensure these don’t take place anymore. This was the issue you mentioned last time with block 61885380 above. Additionally, we can decrease the block proposal timeout so we can lower the delayed block from a missed consensus round if this ever takes place again.

- Even though the Tendermint/CometBFT docs don’t make this clear, transactions are only executed in the next block - a concept called deferred/next-block execution. You can find more details/discussion on Github from the core teams: https://github.com/tendermint/tendermint/issues/7898. This means that if you send txs in block N, they are only executed in block N+1.

- There’s a max block gas limit which is currently set to 50M. This prevents spamming/DDoS attacks since if it has very high or even -1, this would allow one to send huge transactions and delay block time by minutes since the node would take a while to process each tx. We’ve observed that we’re currently hitting the block gas limit and we’re going to put up a proposal soon to increase it. This means that even though the validator mempool might have 100 txs, only 40 or 50 will be included (up to 50M gas) so you’re experiencing unnecessary delay. As an example, this tx spent 1M gas: https://explorer.injective.network/transaction/2CC4E5A54D23AF6CC599E7A4328CAE2EFBF6719F40976985E2381A3411B6DD0A/. There are other txs that spend 200K or even 3-5M in gas. Based on some empirical observations, a reasonable gas increase in the block will not cause any performance issues but we’re running more extensive tests and we’ll put up a proposal soon. We’ll be increasing this value progressively as we scale up along with some on-chain improvements.

- As more nodes get online in the network, this will increase the P2P latency. Gossip latency might increase depending on the peers on the node you sent your tx. Consider this scenario:

A. There are 400 nodes online in the network, the node you broadcast to has 40 peers but none of these peers is the validator proposing the next block.

B. Your node will gossip to its 40 peers, then these 40 peers will gossip to the next peers etc.

C. We don’t have metrics as to how long it takes for a tx to be gossiped but there’s some latency involved here since every node will run checkTx/validations before it includes the tx in its mempool.

On the other hand, your node might have direct peering with the block proposer for the upcoming block so you have zero P2P latency.

9. Can I have my own client id to send messages through the API?
No, we don't store private information on the Injective Chain.

10. Would I save gas fees if I batch messages in transactions?
Yes, a transaction includes fields such as messages, fee, signatures, memo and timeout height. When you send a batch of messages in a single transaction, the transaction size is less than the cumulative transaction size of individual transactions which ultimately results in less gas fees.

11. What is the timeout_height?
The timeout_height specifies a height at which your transaction will timeout and eventually prevents it from being committed past a certain height. Essentially, the transaction will be discarded from the mempool (timeout) after the block with number timeout_height has been mined and your sequence number is cleared if a bad transaction with a lower account sequence does not get processed correctly.

12. Do fee discounts apply to all markets?
Discounts apply to all markets apart from markets that have negative maker fees or markets that have been explicitly excluded.

13. What is the block time on the network?
The average block time is 800ms.

14. Does gas fee affect block inclusion and transaction ordering?
Gas fee affects block inclusion but not ordering, currently there's no ordering of transactions other than the order they've arrived (based on the sequence number). For more information refer to the Tendermint docs

15. When may I see account sequence mismatch errors?
On a high-level, when a sentry node receives a transaction it runs a CheckTx to verify the validity of the transaction which includes stateless and stateful checks. One of those checks is to verify that the sender’s sequence number is valid - the sequence number is primarily used for replay protection and it also affects the ordering logic of transactions.

When you broadcast multiple transactions sequentially to the node the sequence is incremented by one for each transaction and your transactions will be included in a block in the order they arrive (based on the sequence). Should the transaction pass all the checks from CheckTx then it is included in the nodes’ mempool (an in-memory pool of transactions unique to each node) which will be gossiped to other peers in the network prior to consensus. When the transaction reaches the proposer validator node then it will be included in a block. Note that in Tendermint BFT (cosmos-sdk consensus algorithm) finality is absolute, meaning that transactions are finalized when they are included in a block.

There are a couple of reasons you might see account sequence mismatch errors:

1) If you run a trading bot and at the same time you try to broadcast a transaction on the DEX you'll end up with a sequence mismatch since the bot will fetch the sequence from the node and the same will happen with the Frontend so you end up broadcasting a transaction with the same sequence number. Similarly, if you run a trading bot with the same private key you'll also see sequence mismatch errors, thus you should use the private key only at one platform at a time.

2) In the examples we're using a function to handle the sequence locally because if you send multiple transactions in a single block the only way to do that is to use local sequence as until the tx is confirmed the peers in the network are not aware that the sequence has been increased. Essentially, we fetch the sequence the first time through the node directly and then handle it locally for consecutive transactions. If you use sync/async and fetch the sequence from the node every time opposed to handling it locally then you'll occasionally end up with a sequence mismatch.

You can refer to these functions below for sdk-python.

https://github.com/InjectiveLabs/sdk-python/blob/master/pyinjective/wallet.py#L269

https://github.com/InjectiveLabs/sdk-python/blob/master/pyinjective/wallet.py#L296

On the other hand, if you use broadcast mode you essentially expect the tx to be included in a block and then you'll get a response back from the sentry - that's not really recommended since it's wasting a lot of resources from the sentry and it's slower on the client-side too but in this case it guarantees that the sequence will always be unique and you can fetch it from the node every time you send a tx.

3) If you broadcasted a transaction with gas fee lower than the minimum threshold on the node then this transaction will remain in the mempool until the node is restarted and the transaction is discarded or until the transaction expires (if you've set a timeout_height before you broadcasted it). If a transaction is stuck in the mempool then you won't be able to broadcast transactions to that node (and potentially to other nodes in the network if it has been gossiped) since the account sequence will be incorrect. To ensure that transactions don't get stuck in the mempool please use the gas fee set in the examples.

16. What are the broadcast modes I can use to send a transaction?
Sync: Wait for the tx to pass/fail CheckTx

Async: Don’t wait for the tx to pass/fail CheckTx; send and return tx immediately

17. When may I see a max subscriptions per client error?
You can open up to 5 chain channels per IP, if you run more than 5 trading bots from the same IP then this error would naturally show up and you should use a different IP. Every trading bot should open one chain channel only, thus if you're seeing this error and don't have 5 distinct trading bots then it indicates an issue in your logic. If you want to broadcast multiple transactions in a single block you can use sync mode and open one channel only. You can refer here for the chain channel initialization in sdk-python.

18. How long does it take until the Exchange API returns my orders/trades after the transaction has been sent?
This depends on a lot of factors such as the P2P network topology and geolocation of the client-server. When you broadcast a transaction, the following cycle takes place:

1) The transaction is gossiped to other peers in the network

2) The transaction eventually reaches the proposer node

3) Validators participating in the consensus round sign the block and it's produced on-chain

4) The block information is gossiped to the read-only peers (sentry nodes)

5) The events emitted by the chain are picked up by the indexer (Exchange API) and included in a MongoDB

6) Exchange API will query MongoDB to fetch you the data

7) Geolocation between client-sentry will determine the latency until the data is served on the client
